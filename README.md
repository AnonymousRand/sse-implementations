# SSE-Implementations

To install the OpenSSL libraries required to run this: `sudo apt install libssl-dev`

Thanks to <https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption#C.2B.2B_Programs> for a rough guide to encryption and decryption in OpenSSL, specifically with more C++-friendly syntax.

Thanks to <https://stackoverflow.com/a/34624592> for providing me a stupidly simple way to make said C++-friendly syntax work after hours of soul-searching and hair-pulling.
